# Participation in antd-mini construction

The development of antd-mini is inseparable from every user in the community. To help you participate in the co-construction, here is some necessary information.

## Project operation process

### issue

When you encounter problems or requirements in the use of the component library, you can go to the issue area to consult or ask questions. We have prepared a variety of issue templates, please choose the applicable one according to the actual situation. At the same time, if you can help solve other people's doubts, we will also be very grateful.

### feature request

If the current component library does not meet your development needs, please submit an issue to explain the functionality you need. Note, however, that not all submitted requirements will necessarily be fulfilled. The antd-mini is located in the base component library and does not contain business class components. We discuss each submitted requirement, and once it is confirmed that it is required for the underlying functionality, we initiate the development process.

### bug feedback

When submitting bug feedback, please provide relevant information as complete as possible so that we can quickly reproduce and solve the problem.

Here are some considerations when submitting:

- Provide device information, client version, component library version and specific components;
- Explain the behavior of the components you expect and the behavior that actually occurs;
- Describe in detail the steps to reproduce the problem;
- If feasible, provide examples or demos that can reproduce the problem to speed up problem positioning.

## Contribution Code

We cordially invite you to contribute code to antd-mini. See[Contribution Guide](./contribute.md)Learn more. Before contributing code, be sure to submit an RFC issue and describe your changes in detail so that we can fully discuss them in the RFC to save both parties time.
